---

The \`@expo/cli\` package is a CLI binary that should be used via the \`expo\` package, like \`npx expo start\` (or \`npx expo\` for short).

\`\`\` npx expo \`\`\`

> ⭐️ Be sure to star the Expo GitHub repo if you enjoy using the project!

## Design

This CLI has the following purposes:

- Be a minimal interface for starting a local development server that emulates a production EAS Updates server. The development server is the proxy between a native runtime (Expo Go, Dev Client) and a JS Bundler (Metro, Webpack). - To accomplish secure manifest signing for the web, like AsyncStorage or Permissions where both require https/SSL, we need an authenticated Expo account. This is the only reason we include the authentication commands \`login\`, \`logout\`, \`whoami\`, \`register\`. Standard web CLIs don't have authentication commands because they either don't set up https or they use emulation via packages like \`devcert\`. - Orchestrating various native tools like Xcode, \`Simulator.app\`, Android Studio, ADB, etc. to make native builds as painless as possible. \`run:ios\`, \`run:android\` commands. - Implementing a versioned \`prebuild\` command that can reliably work with a project for long periods of time. Prebuild is like a bundler for native code, it generates the **android** and **ios** folders based on the project Expo config (**app.json**). - \`npx expo config\` is auxiliary to \`npx expo prebuild\` and used for debugging/introspection. - Installing versioned libraries with \`npx expo install\` this is a minimal utility born out of pure necessity since versioning in React Native is hard to get right.

# Contributing

To develop the CLI run (defaults to watch mode):

\`\`\` yarn build \`\`\`

We highly recommend setting up an alias for the Expo CLI so you can try it in projects all around your computer. Open your **.zshrc** or other config file and add:

\`\`\` alias nexpo="/path/to/expo/packages/@expo/cli/build/bin/cli" \`\`\`

Then use it with \`nexpo\` like \`nexpo config\`. You can also set up a debug version:

\`\`\` alias expo-inspect="node --inspect /path/to/expo/packages/@expo/cli/build/bin/cli" \`\`\`

Then you can run it and visit \`chrome://inspect/#devices\` in Chrome, and press **"Open dedicated DevTools for Node"** to get a debugger attached to your process. When debugging the CLI, you'll want to disable workers whenever possible, this will make all code run on the same thread, this is mostly applicable to the \`start\` command, i.e. \`expo-inspect start --max-workers 0\`.

## Format

- Be sure to update the [\`CHANGELOG.md\`](./CHANGELOG.md) with changes for every PR. You only need to add the message, our GitHub bot will automatically suggest adding your name and PR number to the diff. - End \`async\` functions with \`Async\` like \`runAsync\`. This is just how we format functions at Expo. - When throwing errors, always opt for \`CommandError\` instead of \`Error\` -- this helps with debugging and making the experience feel more coherent. - Utilize the unified \`Log\` module instead of \`console.log\`. - When logging with variables, utilize the following format \`Something happened (foo: bar, baz: foz)\`. - Avoid other formats like \`Something happened: bar, foz\` or \`Something happened: foo=bar, baz=foz\`. - Main UI components like command names (\`expo start\`), arguments (\`--port\`), and \`--help\` messages should be modified internally, by the Expo team to ensure the developer experience is unified across Expo tooling. External contributions modifying these core aspects may be rejected. - Use the \`profile\` utility method with the \`EXPO_PROFILE=1\` environment variable to measure execution time. - Avoid globals and singletons as these make testing harder and less predictable. The only global we have (at the time of writing this) is the \`isOffline\` boolean.

## Environment

- Always be cautious of the transitive size of dependencies. [packagephobia](https://packagephobia.now.sh/) is a great resource for determining if a package is lean. Try to minimize adding dependencies to the CLI. - We build the CLI using \`taskr\` + \`swc\`, this is partially inspired by Next.js' local CLI. - The build pipeline will inline the CLI version as an environment variable that is accessible anywhere in the CLI codebase. You can access it via \`process.env.__EXPO_VERSION\` instead of reading the local \`package.json\` at runtime. - Unlike the legacy global Expo CLI, this CLI is shipped with \`expo\` meaning the SDK Version is always present. - Reduce SDK specific tasks since only one SDK should be accounted for in a single version of \`@expo/cli\`. - The \`@expo/config\` method \`getConfig\` does not need the \`skipSDKVersionRequirement\` in any case since \`expo\` should always be installed. Ex: \`getConfig('...', { skipSDKVersionRequirement: true });\` shouldn't be used. - Also unlike the global Expo CLI we can assume that node modules are always installed since this CLI should be used via a project's local **node_modules** folder. - This means we can't perform operations that upgrade the \`expo\` package as these may kill the running process. Features that need this pattern (like \`expo upgrade\`) should live in standalone global tools.

## Testing

There are two testing scripts:

- \`yarn test\`: Controlled unit and integration tests. - \`yarn test:e2e\`: End to end testing for CLI commands. This requires the files to be built with \`yarn build\`.

---

- You can target a specific set of tests with the \`--watch\` flag. Example: \`yarn test --watch config\`. - We use backticks for \`it\` blocks. Example <code>it(\`works\`)</code>. - If a pull request is fully self-contained to the \`packages/@expo/cli/\` folder (i.e. no \`yarn.lock\` modifications, etc.) then most native CI tests will be skipped, making CI pass faster in PRs.

### Unit Testing Guidelines

- Use \`nock\` for network requests. - No top level \`describe\` blocks that wrap all the tests in a file. - When testing a function, pass the function to the \`describe\` block instead of a stringified function name: - \`describe(foobar, () => {})\` instead of \`describe('foobar', () => {})\` - Use virtual \`fs\` via \`memfs\` whenever possible. - We have a lot of global module [**mocks**](./e2e/setup.ts) already in place, consider them when writing tests. - GitHub Copilot can make writing tests a little less tedious.

### E2E Testing Guidelines

- E2E tests should be resilient and reliable, be sure to give them plenty of time for network requests. - When testing locally you had to have [Bun installed](https://bun.sh/docs/installation). - When testing locally you should attempt to reuse node modules for faster results. In the \`npx expo prebuild\` and \`npx expo start\` commands for instance, we utilize a helper method that will default to reusing a project + **node_modules** when run locally. This can be [toggled off](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/11a5a4d27b7e1c8e4d6ddf0401397d789d89f52a/packages/%40expo/cli/e2e/__tests__/utils.ts#L174) to bootstrap a fresh project every time. - When bootstrapping test projects, utilize the temporary folder \`os.tmpdir()\` as this folder is automatically cleaned up when the computer restarts.

## Coming from Expo CLI

> TL;DR: \`expo-cli\` was 'make it work', whereas \`@expo/cli\` is 'make it right, make it fast'.

The legacy global \`expo-cli\` package was deprecated in favor of this versioned \`@expo/cli\` package for the following reasons:

- \`expo-cli\` was too big and took way too long to install. This made CI frustrating to set up since you needed to also target global node modules for caching. - \`expo-cli\` worked for almost all versions of the \`expo\` package, meaning it was getting more complex with every release. - \`expo-cli\` combined service commands (like the legacy \`build\`, \`submit\`, \`publish\`) with project-level commands like \`expo start\`. We've since divided services into \`eas-cli\` and project commands into \`npx expo\` (\`@expo/cli\`). This structure is more optimal/faster for developers since they can install/update commands when they need them. - This CLI utilizes more Node.js standard features like \`$EDITOR\` instead of the custom \`$EXPO_EDITOR\` environment variable. Also transitioning away from \`$EXPO_DEBUG\` and more towards \`$DEBUG=expo:*\`. These types of changes make Expo CLI play nicer with existing tooling. - The DevTools UI has been deprecated to reduce the net installation size, minimize complexity, and make room for future debugging UIs (Hermes/v8 Chrome debugger). - The \`expo start:web\` and \`expo web\` commands have been rolled into \`npx expo start\` as we now lazily load platforms until the device requests them. - Other missing or beta features from \`expo-cli\` may still be getting migrated over to this new CLI. For a more comprehensive breakdown see the [start command PR](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/16160).

# expo/devcert

A fork of \`devcert\` with bundle size optimizations.

# devcert - Development SSL made easy

So, running a local HTTPS server usually sucks. There's a range of approaches, each with their own tradeoff. The common one, using self-signed certificates, means having to ignore scary browser warnings for each project.

devcert makes the process easy. Want a private key and certificate file to use with your server? Just ask:

\`\`\`js let ssl = await devcert.certificateFor("my-app.test"); https.createServer(ssl, app).listen(3000); \`\`\`

Now open https://my-app.test:3000 and voila - your page loads with no scary warnings or hoops to jump through.

> Certificates are cached by name, so two calls for > \`certificateFor('foo')\` will return the same key and certificate.

## Options

When it installs or upgrades, devcert creates a self-signed certificate authority (CA) which it uses to sign all certificates it creates. It will try to register this CA with OS keychains in OSX, Linux, and Windows. However, some HTTP clients (such as Firefox and NodeJS itself) use their own trusted certificate list instead of the operating system's keychain. The \`getCaPath\` and \`getCaBuffer\` options make the CA available in the \`certificateFor()\` return object itself, so that these programs can choose whether to trust it.

### getCaPath

Set this option to \`true\` and the returned object will include a \`caPath\` property, set to the file path of the certificate authority file. Use this path to add the certificate to local trust stores which accept paths as arguments, such as NodeJS's built-in environment variable \`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS\`..

### getCaBuffer

Set this option to \`true\` and the returned object will include a \`ca\` property, set to the UTF-8-encoded contents of the certificate authority file. Use this path to add the certificate to local trust stores which don't use OS settings, lke the examples mentioned above.

### skipHostsFile

If you supply a custom domain name (i.e. any domain other than \`localhost\`) when requesting a certificate from devcert, it will attempt to modify your system to redirect requests for that domain to your local machine (rather than to the real domain). It does this by modifying your \`/etc/hosts\` file.

If you pass in the \`skipHostsFile\` option, devcert will skip this step. This means that if you ask for certificates for \`my-app.test\` (for example), and don't have some other DNS redirect method in place, that you won't be able to access your app at \`https://my-app.test\` because your computer wouldn't know that \`my-app.test\` should resolve your local machine.

Keep in mind that SSL certificates are issued for _domains_, so if you ask for a certificate for \`my-app.test\`, and don't have any kind of DNS redirect in place (\`/etc/hosts\` or otherwise), trying to hit \`localhost\` won't work, even if the app you intended to serve via \`my-app.test\` is running on your local machine (since the SSL certificate won't say \`localhost\`).

### skipCertutil

This option will tell devcert to avoid installing \`certutil\` tooling.

\`certutil\` is a tooling package used to automate the installation of SSL certificates in certain circumstances; specifically, Firefox (for every OS) and Chrome (on Linux only).

Normally, devcert will attempt to install \`certutil\` if it's needed and not already present on your system. If you don't want devcert to install this package, pass \`skipCertutil: true\`.

If you decide to \`skipCertutil\`, the initial setup process for devcert changes in these two scenarios:

- **Firefox on all platforms**: Thankully, Firefox makes this easy. There's a point-and-click wizard for importing and trusting a certificate, so if you specify \`skipCertutil: true\`, devcert will instead automatically open Firefox and kick off this wizard for you. Simply follow the prompts to trust the certificate. **Reminder: you'll only need to do this once per machine**

- **Chrome on Linux**: Unfortunately, it appears that the **only** way to get Chrome to trust an SSL certificate on Linux is via the \`certutil\` tooling - there is no manual process for it. Thus, if you are using Chrome on Linux, do **not** supply \`skipCertuil: true\`. If you do, devcert certificates will not be trusted by Chrome.

The \`certutil\` tooling is installed in OS-specific ways:

- Mac: \`brew install nss\` - Linux: \`apt install libnss3-tools\` - Windows: N/A (there is no easy, hands-off way to install certutil on Windows, so devcert will simply fallback to the wizard approach for Firefox outlined above)

## How it works

When you ask for a development certificate, devcert will first check to see if it has run on this machine before. If not, it will create a root certificate authority and add it to your OS and various browser trust stores. You'll likely see password prompts from your OS at this point to authorize the new root CA.

Since your machine now trusts this root CA, it will trust any certificates signed by it. So when you ask for a certificate for a new domain, devcert will use the root CA credentials to generate a certificate specific to the domain you requested, and return the new certificate to you.

If you request a domain that has already had certificates generated for it, devcert will simply return the cached certificates.

This setup ensures that browsers won't show scary warnings about untrusted certificates, since your OS and browsers will now trust devcert's certificates.

## Security Concerns

There's a reason that your OS prompts you for your root password when devcert attempts to install its root certificate authority. By adding it to your machine's trust stores, your browsers will automatically trust _any_ certificate generated with it.

This exposes a potential attack vector on your local machine: if someone else could use the devcert certificate authority to generate certificates, and if they could intercept / manipulate your network traffic, they could theoretically impersonate some websites, and your browser would not show any warnings (because it trusts the devcert authority).

To prevent this, devcert takes steps to ensure that no one can access the devcert certificate authority credentials to generate malicious certificates without you knowing. The exact approach varies by platform:

- **macOS and Linux**: the certificate authority's credentials are written to files that are only readable by the root user (i.e. \`chown 0 ca-cert.crt\` and \`chmod 600 ca-cert.crt\`). When devcert itself needs these, it shells out to \`sudo\` invocations to read / write the credentials. - **Windows**: because of my unfamiliarity with Windows file permissions, I wasn't confident I would be able to correctly set permissions to mimic the setup on macOS and Linux. So instead, devcert will prompt you for a password, and then use that to encrypt the credentials with an AES256 cipher. The password is never written to disk.

To further protect these credentials, any time they are written to disk, they are written to temporary files, and are immediately deleted after they are no longer needed.

Additionally, the root CA certificate is unique to your machine only: it's generated on-the-fly when it is first installed. ensuring there are no central / shared keys to crack across machines.

### Why install a root certificate authority at all?

The root certificate authority makes it simpler to manage which domains are configured for SSL by devcert. The alternative is to generate and trust self-signed certificates for each domain. The problem is that while devcert is able to add a certificate to your machine's trust stores, the tooling to remove a certificate doesn't cover every case. So if you ever wanted to _untrust_ devcert's certificates, you'd have to manually remove each one from each trust store.

By trusting only a single root CA, devcert is able to guarantee that when you want to _disable_ SSL for a domain, it can do so with no manual intervention

- we just delete the domain-specific certificate files. Since these domain-specific files aren't installed in your trust stores, once they are gone, they are gone.

## Integration

devcert has been designed from day one to work as low-level library that other tools can delegate to. The goal is to make HTTPS development easy for everyone, regardless of framework or library choice.

With that in mind, if you'd like to use devcert in your library/framework/CLI, devcert makes that easy.

In addition to the options above, devcert exposes a \`ui\` option. This option allows you to control all the points where devcert requires user interaction, substituting your own prompts and user interface. You can use this to brand the experience with your own tool's name, localize the messages, or integrate devcert into a larger existing workflow.

The \`ui\` option should be an object with the following methods:

\`\`\`ts { async getWindowsEncryptionPassword(): Promise<string> { // Invoked when devcert needs the password used to encrypt the root // certificate authority credentials on Windows. May be invoked multiple // times if the user's supplied password is incorrect }, async warnChromeOnLinuxWithoutCertutil(): Promise<string> { // Invoked when devcert is run on Linux, detects that Chrome is installed, // and the \`skipCertutil\` option is \`true\`. Used to warn the user that // Chrome will not work with \`skipCertutil: true\` on Linux. }, async closeFirefoxBeforeContinuing() { // Invoked when devcert detects that Firefox is running while it is trying // to programmatically install its certificate authority in the Firefox // trust store. Firefox appears to overwrite changes to the trust store on // exit, so Firefox must be closed before devcert can continue. devcert will // wait for Firefox to exit - this is just to prompt the user that they // need to close the application. }, async startFirefoxWizard(certificateHost: string) { // Invoked when devcert detects a Firefox installation and \`skipCertutil: // true\` was specified. This is invoked right before devcert launches the // Firefox certificate import wizard GUI. Used to give the user a heads up // as to why they are about to see Firefox pop up. // // The certificateHost provided is the URL for the temporary server that // devcert has spun up in order to trigger the wizard(Firefox needs try to // "download" the cert to trigger the wizard). This URL will load the page // supplied in the \`firefoxWizardPromptPage()\` method below. // // Normally, devcert will automatically open this URL, but in case it fails // you may want to print it out to the console with an explanatory message // so the user isn't left hanging wondering what's happening. }, async firefoxWizardPromptPage(certificateURL: string): Promise<string> { // When devcert starts the Firefox certificate installation wizard GUI, it // first loads an HTML page in Firefox. The template used for that page is // the return value of this method. The supplied certificateURL is the path // to the actual certificate. The Firefox tab must attempt to load this URL // to trigger the wizard. // // The default implementation is a simple redirect to that URL. But you could // supply your own branded template here, with a button that says "Install // certificate" that is linked to the certificateURL, along with a more in // depth explanation of what is happening for example. } async waitForFirefoxWizard() { // Invoked _after_ the Firefox certificate import wizard is kicked off. This // method should not resolve until the user indicates that the wizard is // complete (unfortunately, we have no way of determining that // programmatically) } } \`\`\`

You can supply any or all of these methods - ones you do not supply will fall back to the default implementation.

## Testing

Testing a tool like devcert can be a pain. I haven't found a good automated solution for cross platform GUI testing (the GUI part is necessary to test each browser's handling of devcert certificates, as well as test the Firefox wizard flow).

To make things easier, devcert comes with a series of virtual machine images. Each one is a snapshot taken right before running a test - just launch the machine and hit <Enter>.

You can also use the snapshotted state of the VMs to roll them back to a pristine state for another round of testing.

@react-native/babel-preset@0.81.5
MIT
https://github.com/facebook/react-native
# @react-native/babel-preset

Babel presets for [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) applications. React Native itself uses this Babel preset by default when transforming your app's source code.

If you wish to use a custom Babel configuration by writing a \`babel.config.js\` file in your project's root directory, you must specify all the plugins necessary to transform your code. React Native does not apply its default Babel configuration in this case. So, to make your life easier, you can use this preset to get the default configuration and then specify more plugins that run before it.

## Usage

As mentioned above, you only need to use this preset if you are writing a custom \`babel.config.js\` file.

### Installation

Install \`@react-native/babel-preset\` in your app:

with \`npm\`:

\`\`\`sh npm i @react-native/babel-preset --save-dev \`\`\`

or with \`yarn\`:

\`\`\`sh yarn add -D @react-native/babel-preset \`\`\`

### Configuring Babel

Then, create a file called \`babel.config.js\` in your project's root directory. The existence of this \`babel.config.js\` file will tell React Native to use your custom Babel configuration instead of its own. Then load this preset:

\`\`\` { "presets": ["module:@react-native/babel-preset"] } \`\`\`

You can further customize your Babel configuration by specifying plugins and other options. See [Babel's \`babel.config.js\` documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files/) to learn more.

## Help and Support

If you get stuck configuring Babel, please ask a question on Stack Overflow or find a consultant for help. If you discover a bug, please open up an issue.

@react-native/debugger-frontend@0.81.5
BSD-3-Clause
https://github.com/facebook/react-native
# @react-native/debugger-frontend

![npm package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@react-native/debugger-frontend?color=brightgreen&label=npm%20package)

Debugger frontend for React Native based on Chrome DevTools.

This package is internal to React Native and is intended to be used via [\`@react-native/dev-middleware\`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native/dev-middleware).

## Usage

The package exports the absolute path to the directory containing the frontend assets.

\`\`\`js const frontendPath = require('@react-native/debugger-frontend');

// Pass frontendPath to a static server, etc \`\`\`

## Contributing

### Source repo

Source code for this package lives in the [facebook/react-native-devtools-frontend](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-devtools-frontend) repo. See below for how we build and check in changes.

### Updating the frontend assets

The compiled assets for the debugger frontend are periodically checked into this package under the \`dist/\` folder. To update these, run \`node scripts/debugger-frontend/sync-and-build\` from the root of your \`react-native\` checkout.

\`\`\`sh # For main node scripts/debugger-frontend/sync-and-build --branch main

# For stable branches (e.g. '0.73-stable') node scripts/debugger-frontend/sync-and-build --branch 0.73-stable \`\`\`

By default, this will clone and build from [facebook/react-native-devtools-frontend](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-devtools-frontend).

@react-native/dev-middleware@0.81.5
MIT
https://github.com/facebook/react-native
# @react-native/dev-middleware

![npm package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@react-native/dev-middleware?color=brightgreen&label=npm%20package)

Dev server middleware supporting core React Native development features. This package is preconfigured in all React Native projects.

## Usage

Middleware can be attached to a dev server (e.g. [Metro](https://facebook.github.io/metro/docs/getting-started)) using the \`createDevMiddleware\` API.

\`\`\`js import { createDevMiddleware } from '@react-native/dev-middleware';

function myDevServerImpl(args) { ...

const {middleware, websocketEndpoints} = createDevMiddleware({ projectRoot: metroConfig.projectRoot, serverBaseUrl: \`http://\${args.host}:\${args.port}\`, logger, });

await Metro.runServer(metroConfig, { host: args.host, ..., unstable_extraMiddleware: [ middleware, // Optionally extend with additional HTTP middleware ], websocketEndpoints: { ...websocketEndpoints, // Optionally extend with additional WebSocket endpoints }, }); } \`\`\`

## Included middleware

\`@react-native/dev-middleware\` is designed for integrators such as [\`@expo/dev-server\`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@expo/dev-server) and [\`@react-native/community-cli-plugin\`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/main/packages/community-cli-plugin). It provides a common default implementation for core React Native dev server responsibilities.

We intend to keep this to a narrow set of functionality, based around:

- **Debugging** — The [Chrome DevTools protocol (CDP)](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) endpoints supported by React Native, including the Inspector Proxy, which facilitates connections with multiple devices. - **Dev actions** — Endpoints implementing core [Dev Menu](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#accessing-the-dev-menu) actions, e.g. reloading the app, opening the debugger frontend.

### HTTP endpoints

<small>\`DevMiddlewareAPI.middleware\`</small>

These are exposed as a [\`connect\`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect) middleware handler, assignable to \`Metro.runServer\` or other compatible HTTP servers.

#### GET \`/json/list\`, \`/json\` ([CDP](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/#endpoints))

Returns the list of available WebSocket targets for all connected React Native app sessions.

#### GET \`/json/version\` ([CDP](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/#endpoints))

Returns version metadata used by Chrome DevTools.

#### GET \`/debugger-frontend\`

Subpaths of this endpoint are reserved to serve the JavaScript debugger frontend.

#### POST \`/open-debugger\`

Open the JavaScript debugger for a given CDP target. Must be provided with one of the following query params:

- \`device\`‌ — An ID unique to a combination of device and app, stable across installs. Implemented by \`getInspectorDeviceId\` on each native platform. - \`target\` — The target page ID as returned by \`/json/list\` for the current dev server session. - \`appId\` (deprecated, legacy only) — The application bundle identifier to match (non-unique across multiple connected devices). This param will only match legacy Hermes debugger targets.

<details> <summary>Example</summary>

curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8081/open-debugger?target=<targetId>' </details>

### WebSocket endpoints

<small>\`DevMiddlewareAPI.websocketEndpoints\`</small>

#### \`/inspector/device\`

WebSocket handler for registering device connections.

#### \`/inspector/debug\`

WebSocket handler that proxies CDP messages to/from the corresponding device.

argparse@2.0.1
Python-2.0
https://github.com/nodeca/argparse
A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became Zope Corporation. In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.

Release Derived Year Owner GPL- from compatible? (1)

0.9.0 thru 1.2 1991-1995 CWI yes 1.3 thru 1.5.2 1.2 1995-1999 CNRI yes 1.6 1.5.2 2000 CNRI no 2.0 1.6 2000 BeOpen.com no 1.6.1 1.6 2001 CNRI yes (2) 2.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF no 2.0.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF yes 2.1.1 2.1+2.0.1 2001 PSF yes 2.1.2 2.1.1 2002 PSF yes 2.1.3 2.1.2 2002 PSF yes 2.2 and above 2.1.1 2001-now PSF yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL. All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source. The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause. According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.

babel-preset-expo@54.0.9
MIT
https://github.com/expo/expo
# babel-preset-expo

This preset extends the default React Native preset (\`@react-native/babel-preset\`) and adds support for tree shaking, bundle splitting, React Server Components, Hermes compilation, advanced dead-code elimination, reanimated, Expo DOM components, server-side rendering, and more...

You can use this preset in any React Native project as a drop-in replacement for \`@react-native/babel-preset\`.

If you have problems with the code in this repository, please file issues & bug reports at https://github.com/expo/expo.

## Expo Bundler Spec Compliance

A bundler must follow these requirements if they are to be considered spec compliant for use with a **universal React** (Expo) project.

## Options

### \`react-compiler\`

Settings to pass to \`babel-plugin-react-compiler\`. Set as \`false\` to disable the plugin. As of SDK 51, you must also enable \`experiments.reactCompiler: true\` in the \`app.json\`.

\`\`\`js [ 'babel-preset-expo', { 'react-compiler': { sources: (filename) => { // Match file names to include in the React Compiler. return filename.includes('src/path/to/dir'); }, }, }, ]; \`\`\`

### \`minifyTypeofWindow\`

Set \`minifyTypeofWindow: true\` to transform \`typeof window\` checks in your code, e.g. \`if (typeof window === 'object')\` -> \`if (true)\` in clients. This is useful when you're using libraries that mock the window object on native or in the server.

\`\`\`js [ 'babel-preset-expo', { // If your native app doesn't polyfill \`window\` then setting this to \`false\` can reduce bundle size. native: { minifyTypeofWindow: true, }, }, ]; \`\`\`

Defaults to \`true\` for server environments, and \`false\` for client environments to support legacy browser polyfills and web workers.

### \`reanimated\`

\`boolean\`, defaults to \`true\`. Set \`reanimated: false\` to disable adding the \`react-native-reanimated/plugin\` when \`react-native-reanimated\` is installed.

### \`worklets\`

\`boolean\`, \`boolean\`, defaults to \`true\`. Set \`worklets: false\` to disable adding the \`react-native-worklets/plugin\` when \`react-native-worklets\` is installed. Applies only when using standalone \`react-native-worklets\` or \`react-native-reanimated 4\`.

### [\`jsxRuntime\`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#runtime)

\`classic | automatic\`, defaults to \`automatic\`

- \`automatic\` automatically convert JSX to JS without the need to \`import React from 'react'\` in every file. Be sure to follow the rest of the [setup guide](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html#how-to-upgrade-to-the-new-jsx-transform) after enabling this, otherwise ESLint and other tools will throw warnings. - \`classic\` does not automatically import anything, React must imported into every file that uses JSX syntax.

\`\`\`js [ 'babel-preset-expo', { jsxRuntime: 'classic', }, ]; \`\`\`

This property is passed down to [\`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx\`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx). This flag does nothing when \`useTransformReactJSXExperimental\` is set to \`true\` because \`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx\` is omitted.

### [\`jsxImportSource\`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#importsource)

\`string\`, defaults to \`react\`

This option allows specifying a custom import source for importing functions.

\`\`\`js [ 'babel-preset-expo', { jsxRuntime: 'automatic', jsxImportSource: 'react', }, ]; \`\`\`

This property is passed down to [\`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx\`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx). This options does nothing when \`jsxRuntime\` is not set to \`automatic\`.

### [\`lazyImports\`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy)

Changes Babel's compiled \`import\` statements to be lazily evaluated when their imported bindings are used for the first time.

_Note:_ this option has an effect only when the \`disableImportExportTransform\` option is set to \`false\`. On Android and iOS, \`disableImportExportTransform\` defaults to \`false\`, and on web it defaults to \`true\` to allow for tree shaking.

This can improve the initial load time of your app because evaluating dependencies up front is sometimes entirely un-necessary, particularly when the dependencies have no side effects.

The value of \`lazyImports\` has a few possible effects:

- \`null\` - [@react-native/babel-preset](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/main/packages/react-native-babel-preset) will handle it. (Learn more about it here: https://github.com/facebook/metro/commit/23e3503dde5f914f3e642ef214f508d0a699851d) - \`false\` - No lazy initialization of any imported module. - \`true\` - Lazy-init all imported modules except local imports (e.g., \`./foo\`), certain Expo packages that have side effects, and the two cases mentioned [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy). - \`Array<string>\` - [babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy) will handle it. - \`(string) => boolean\` - [babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy) will handle it.

If you choose to do this, you can also access the list of Expo packages that have side effects by using \`const lazyImportsBlacklist = require('babel-preset-expo/lazy-imports-blacklist');\` which returns a \`Set\`.

**default:** \`null\`

\`\`\`js [ 'babel-preset-expo', { lazyImports: true } ], \`\`\`

### \`disableImportExportTransform\`

Pass \`true\` to disable the transform that converts import/export to \`module.exports\`. Avoid setting this property directly. If you're using Metro, set \`experimentalImportSupport: true\` instead to ensure the entire pipeline is configured correctly.

\`\`\`js // metro.config.js

config.transformer.getTransformOptions = async () => ({ transform: { // Setting this to \`true\` will automatically toggle \`disableImportExportTransform\` in \`babel-preset-expo\`. experimentalImportSupport: true, }, }); \`\`\`

If \`undefined\` (default), this will be set automatically via \`caller.supportsStaticESM\` which is set by the bundler.

\`\`\`js [ 'babel-preset-expo', { disableImportExportTransform: true } ], \`\`\`

### \`unstable_transformProfile\`

Changes the engine preset in \`@react-native/babel-preset\` based on the JavaScript engine that is being targeted. In Expo SDK 50 and greater, this is automatically set based on the [\`jsEngine\`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#jsengine) option in your \`app.json\`.

### \`unstable_transformImportMeta\`

Enable that transform that converts \`import.meta\` to \`globalThis.__ExpoImportMetaRegistry\`, defaults to \`false\` in client bundles and \`true\` for server bundles.

> **Note:** Use this option at your own risk. If the JavaScript engine supports \`import.meta\` natively, this transformation may interfere with the native implementation.

### \`enableBabelRuntime\`

Passed to \`@react-native/babel-preset\`.

### \`disableFlowStripTypesTransform\`

Passed to \`@react-native/babel-preset\`.

## Platform-specific options

All options can be passed in the platform-specific objects \`native\` and \`web\` to provide different settings on different platforms. For example, if you'd like to only apply \`disableImportExportTransform\` on web, use the following:

\`\`\`js [ 'babel-preset-expo', { // Default value: disableImportExportTransform: false,

web: { // Web-specific value: disableImportExportTransform: true, }, }, ]; \`\`\`

Platform-specific options have higher priority over top-level options.

### Babel Loader

The Babel loading mechanism must include the following properties on its \`caller\`.

#### platform

A \`platform\` property denoting the target platform. If the \`platform\` is not defined, it will default to using \`web\` when the \`bundler\` is \`webpack\` -- this is temporary and will throw an error in the future.

| Value | Description | | --------- | ----------------------- | | \`ios\` | Runs on iOS devices | | \`android\` | Runs on Android devices | | \`web\` | Runs in web browsers |

#### bundler

A \`bundler\` property denoting the name of the bundler that is being used to create the JavaScript bundle. If the \`bundler\` is not defined, it will default to checking if a \`babel-loader\` is used, if so then \`webpack\` will be used, otherwise it will default to \`metro\`.

| Value | Description | | --------- | -------------------------------- | | \`metro\` | Bundling with [Metro][metro] | | \`webpack\` | Bundling with [Webpack][webpack] |

[metro]: https://facebook.github.io/metro/ [webpack]: https://webpack.js.org/

#boolbase This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (\`trueFunc\`) and one that always returns false (\`falseFunc\`).

###WTF?

By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [\`CSSselect\`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.

###And why is this a separate module?

I'm trying to modularize \`CSSselect\` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.

# BSER Binary Serialization

BSER is a binary serialization scheme that can be used as an alternative to JSON. BSER uses a framed encoding that makes it simpler to use to stream a sequence of encoded values.

It is intended to be used for local-IPC only and strings are represented as binary with no specific encoding; this matches the convention employed by most operating system filename storage.

For more details about the serialization scheme see [Watchman's docs](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/bser.html).

## API

\`\`\`js var bser = require('bser'); \`\`\`

### bser.loadFromBuffer

The is the synchronous decoder; given an input string or buffer, decodes a single value and returns it. Throws an error if the input is invalid.

\`\`\`js var obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf); \`\`\`

### bser.dumpToBuffer

Synchronously encodes a value as BSER.

\`\`\`js var encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']); console.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello'] \`\`\`

### BunserBuf

The asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object. You may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the decoded values via its \`value\` event.

\`\`\`js var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();

bunser.on('value', function(obj) { console.log(obj); }); \`\`\`

Then in your socket \`data\` event:

\`\`\`js bunser.append(buf); \`\`\`

## Example

Read BSER from socket:

\`\`\`js var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();

bunser.on('value', function(obj) { console.log('data from socket', obj); });

var socket = net.connect('/socket');

socket.on('data', function(buf) { bunser.append(buf); }); \`\`\`

Write BSER to socket:

\`\`\`js socket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj)); \`\`\`

Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC- licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

=======================================================================

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 -- Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.

b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.

i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 -- Scope.

a. License grant.

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a) (4) never produces Adapted Material.

5. Downstream recipients.

a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

b. Other rights.

1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

a. Attribution.

1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:

i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

ii. a copyright notice;

iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;

b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.

2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.

Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:

1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 -- Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

expo-dev-launcher@6.0.20
MIT
https://github.com/expo/expo
# expo-dev-launcher

\`expo-dev-launcher\` is an npm package installable in any Expo or React Native project. Once installed, any Debug builds of your application will gain the ability to load projects from Expo CLI. Release builds of your application will not change other than the addition of a few header files. This package is intended to be included in your project through [\`expo-dev-client\`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/dev-client/).

## Documentation

You can find more information in the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction).

## Contributing

The \`expo-dev-launcher\` repository consists of two different parts, the exported package, which includes the native functions, located in the \`android\`, \`ios\` and \`src\` folders and the Dev Launcher interface, located under the \`bundle\` folder.

Local development is usually done through \`bare-expo\`.

### Making JavaScript changes inside the \`bundle\` folder

To update the JavaScript code inside the \`bundle\` folder, you need to run the \`dev-launcher\` bundler locally.

1. Navigate to the \`dev-launcher\` package: \`cd packages/expo-dev-launcher\` 2. Start the Metro bundler: \`yarn start\` 3. Adjust the dev-launcher URL to point to your local bundler

<details>

#### On Android

Open [DevLauncherController.kt](/packages/expo-dev-launcher/android/src/debug/java/expo/modules/devlauncher/DevLauncherController.kt) and update the \`DEV_LAUNCHER_HOST\` value to your bundler URL.

E.g.

\`\`\`diff - private val DEV_LAUNCHER_HOST: String? = null + private val DEV_LAUNCHER_HOST: String? = "10.0.2.2:8090"; \`\`\`

#### On iOS

3.1. Open another terminal window and navigate to the \`ios\` folder inside \`bare-expo\`

3.2. Export the \`EX_DEV_LAUNCHER_URL\` variable in your shell before running \`pod install\`.

E.g.

\`\`\` export EX_DEV_LAUNCHER_URL=http://localhost:8090 \`\`\`

This will cause the controller to see if the \`expo-launcher\` packager is running, and if so, use that instead of the prebuilt bundle.

3.3. Run \`pod install\`

</details>

4. Recompile \`bare-expo\` 5. Play with your changes on a simulator or device 6. Once you've made all the necessary changes run \`yarn bundle\` to update the embedded bundle

Interface for \`expo-dev-menu\`.

# Installation in managed Expo projects

For [managed](https://docs.expo.dev/archive/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects, please follow the installation instructions in the [API documentation for the latest stable release](#api-documentation). If you follow the link and there is no documentation available then this library is not yet usable within managed projects &mdash; it is likely to be included in an upcoming Expo SDK release.

# Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the \`expo\` package](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) before continuing.

### Add the package to your npm dependencies

\`\`\` npm install expo-dev-menu-interface \`\`\`

# 📦 expo-dev-menu

Expo/React Native module to add developer menu to Debug builds of your application. This package is intended to be included in your project through [\`expo-dev-client\`](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/#what-is-an-expo-dev-client).

## Documentation

You can find more information in the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction).

## Contributing

The \`expo-dev-menu\` repository consists of two different parts, the exported package, which includes the native functions, located in the \`android\`, \`ios\` and \`src\` folders and the Dev Menu interface, located under the \`app\` folder.

Local development is usually done through [\`bare-expo\`](/apps/bare-expo).

First, make sure to \`yarn\` and \`yarn start\` in \`expo-dev-menu\` which will add the port for the dev menu packager to [\`dev-menu-packager-host\`](./assets/dev-menu-packager-host). This is bundled into the native code in \`bare-expo\` so it needs to be done first. When done with local development, you need to reset the contents of \`dev-menu-packager-host\`!

### Making JavaScript changes inside the \`app\` folder

To update the JavaScript code inside the \`app\` folder, you need to run the \`dev-menu\` bundler locally.

1. Navigate to the \`dev-menu\` package: \`cd packages/expo-dev-menu\` 2. Start the Metro bundler: \`yarn start\` 3. To use your local bundler on Android, open [DevMenuManager.kt](/packages/expo-dev-menu/android/src/debug/java/expo/modules/devmenu/DevMenuManager.kt) and set \`useDeveloperSupport\` to \`true\`.

\`\`\`diff - val useDeveloperSupport = false + val useDeveloperSupport = true \`\`\`

4. Play with your changes on a simulator or device through \`bare-expo\` 5. Once you've made all the necessary changes run \`yarn bundle:prod:ios && yarn bundle:prod:android\` to update the embedded bundle

# Importing native dependencies - autolinking

Many React Native libraries come with platform-specific (native) code. This native code has to be linked into the project and, in some cases, configured further. These actions require some modifications to the native project files. One of the steps that has to be done with the native configuration is to enable the autolinking mechanism that takes care of including any supported module's native code into the project. The following configuration is required:

### iOS

> Caution! After you have made the following changes you will need to run \`pod install\` again.

\`\`\`ruby # Podfile

require File.join(File.dirname(\`node --print "require.resolve('react-native/package.json')"\`), "scripts/react_native_pods") require File.join(File.dirname(\`node --print "require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')"\`), "cocoapods.rb") require File.join(File.dirname(\`node --print "require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')"\`), "scripts/autolinking")

# ...

target "TargetName" do use_unimodules! config = use_native_modules! use_react_native!(:path => config["reactNativePath"])

# ... end \`\`\`

### Android

\`\`\`groovy // app/build.gradle

apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../gradle.groovy") apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('react-native/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../react.gradle") apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('expo-updates/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../scripts/create-manifest-android.gradle")

// ...

apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../native_modules.gradle"); applyNativeModulesAppBuildGradle(project) \`\`\`

\`\`\`groovy // settings.gradle

apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../gradle.groovy"); includeUnimodulesProjects()

apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../native_modules.gradle"); applyNativeModulesSettingsGradle(settings) \`\`\`

### Explanation

The scripts that are referenced in Gradle and Cocoapods are usually found the related package inside the project's \`node_modules\` directory. In the case of monorepos (such as Yarn workspaces) the project directory may not contain \`node_modules\` at all; instead, the modules are likely to be located at the root of the repository. In order to ensure that both cases are supported, we take advantage of the Node dependency resolution strategy. We invoke a subprocess that spawns the simple JavaScript snippet that tries to locate the desired npm package containing the script we need.

- On iOS, we use [\`\` \` \` \`\` (backtick)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3159945/running-command-line-commands-within-ruby-script) ([alternative reference](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/Kernel.html#method-i-60)). - On Android, we use [String[]#execute](<http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/lang/String[].html#execute()>) to obtain the results from the subprocess' stdout.

The Node process that is spawned runs [\`require.resolve\`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/modules.html#modules_require_resolve_request_options) to obtain the path to a module's \`package.json\`(if you look for the module location using solely module name, you'll be given the path to the file pointed by the \`main\` attribute from the \`package.json\` and we need to know the location of the module's root directory). We then assemble the path to the desired script and execute it.

You can read more about the scripts and libraries used in the examples above in their official READMEs.

\`\`\`sh # You should clone expo/expo git repository first $ cd packages/expo-sqlite

# Download and build sqlite3.[ch] # For example, to use sqlite 3.45.3 and sqlcipher 4.6.0 $ ./scripts/prepare_sqlite.ts vendor/sqlite3 3.45.3 $ ./scripts/prepare_sqlite.ts vendor/sqlcipher 4.6.0 --sqlcipher

# Replace sqlite3 symbols to prevent conflict with iOS system sqlite3 $ ./scripts/replace_symbols.ts vendor/sqlite3 $ ./scripts/replace_symbols.ts vendor/sqlcipher \`\`\`

fb-watchman@2.0.2
Apache-2.0
https://github.com/facebook/watchman
# fb-watchman

\`fb-watchman\` is a filesystem watcher that uses the [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) file watching service from Facebook.

Watchman provides file change notification services using very efficient recursive watches and also allows more advanced change matching and filesystem tree querying operations using [a powerful expression syntax](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/file-query.html#expressions).

## Install

You should [install Watchman]( https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) to make the most of this module.

Then simply:

\`\`\` $ npm install fb-watchman \`\`\`

## Key Concepts

- Watchman recursively watches directories. - Each watched directory is called a \`root\`. - You must initiate a \`watch\` on a \`root\` using the \`watch-project\` command prior to subscribing to changes - Rather than separately watching many sibling directories, \`watch-project\` consolidates and re-uses existing watches relative to a project root (the location of your \`.watchmanconfig\` or source control repository root) - change notifications are relative to the project root

## How do I use it?

[Read the NodeJS watchman documentation](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/nodejs.html)

imurmurhash@0.1.4
MIT
https://github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js
iMurmurHash.js ==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation ------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

\`\`\`html <script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script> <script> // Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3 </script> \`\`\`

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

\`\`\`bash npm install imurmurhash \`\`\`

Then simply include it in your scripts:

\`\`\`javascript MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash'); \`\`\`

Quick Example -------------

\`\`\`javascript // Create the initial hash var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text hashState.hash('more strings'); hashState.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');

// Get a result hashState.result(); // returns 0xe4ccfe6b \`\`\`

Functions ---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed]) Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the \`new\` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use \`new\` to create a new state object. For example:

\`\`\`javascript // Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same // object (but reset, so the current state would be lost) hashState = MurmurHash3(); ...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the // function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss // will occur, at the cost of creating more objects. hashState = new MurmurHash3(); \`\`\`

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string) Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to \`result()\`. Returns \`this\` so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result () Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via \`hash\`.

\`\`\`javascript // Do the whole string at once MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result(); // 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part var m = MurmurHash3('this is a'); m.result(); // 0xbfc4f834 m.hash(' test string').result(); // 0x70529328 (same as above) \`\`\`

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed]) Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns \`this\` so calls can be chained.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities -------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation ---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination --------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.

Disclaimer of Warranty * * ------------------------- * * * * Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" * * basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or * * statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the * * Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a * * particular purpose or non-infringing.

8. Litigation -------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous ----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License ---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses

# Lottie React Native

[![npm Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/lottie-react-native.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lottie-react-native) [![License](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/lottie-react-native.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lottie-react-native)

Lottie component for React Native ([iOS](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios), [Android](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android), and [Windows](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Lottie-Windows))

Lottie is an ecosystem of libraries for parsing [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) animations exported as JSON with [bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin) and rendering them natively!

For the first time, designers can create **and ship** beautiful animations without an engineer painstakingly recreating it by hand.

## Installing

## Breaking Changes in v6!

We've made some significant updates in version 6 that may impact your current setup. To get all the details about these changes, check out the [changelog](/CHANGELOG.md).

Stay informed to ensure a seamless transition to the latest version. Thank you!

### iOS and Android

- Install \`lottie-react-native\` (latest):

\`\`\` yarn add lottie-react-native \`\`\`

Go to your ios folder and run:

\`\`\` pod install \`\`\`

### Web

- Install \`lottie-react-native\` (latest):

\`\`\` yarn add lottie-react-native \`\`\`

- Add dependencies for web players:

\`\`\` yarn add @lottiefiles/dotlottie-react \`\`\`

### Windows (React Native >= 0.63)

<details> <summary>Install the \`lottie-react-native\` npm package. (Click to expand)</summary> <br> Add the following to the end of your project file. For C# apps, this should come after any \`Microsoft.Windows.UI.Xaml.CSharp.targets\` includes. For C++ apps, it should come after any \`Microsoft.Cpp.targets\` includes. \`\`\`xml <PropertyGroup Label="LottieReactNativeProps"> <LottieReactNativeDir>$([MSBuild]::GetDirectoryNameOfFileAbove($(MSBuildThisFileDirectory), 'node_modules\\lottie-react-native\\package.json'))\\node_modules\\lottie-react-native</LottieReactNativeDir> </PropertyGroup> <ImportGroup Label="LottieReactNativeTargets"> <Import Project="$(LottieReactNativeDir)\\src\\windows\\cppwinrt\\PropertySheets\\LottieGen.Auto.targets" /> </ImportGroup> \`\`\`

Add the LottieReactNative.vcxproj file to your Visual Studio solution to ensure it takes part in the build.

For C# apps, you'll need to install the following packages through NuGet:

- LottieGen.MsBuild - Microsoft.UI.Xaml - Win2D.uwp - Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.UI.Lottie - This package is used for loading JSON dynamically. If you only need codegen animation, you can set \`<EnableLottieDynamicSource>false</EnableLottieDynamicSource>\` in your project file and omit this reference.

For C++ apps, you'll need these NuGet packages:

- LottieGen.MsBuild - Microsoft.UI.Xaml

WinUI 2.6 (Microsoft.UI.Xaml 2.6.0) is required by default. Overriding this requires creating a Directory.Build.props file in your project root with a \`<WinUIVersion>\` property.

In your application code where you set up your React Native Windows PackageProviders list, add the LottieReactNative provider:

\`\`\`csharp // C# PackageProviders.Add(new LottieReactNative.ReactPackageProvider(new AnimatedVisuals.LottieCodegenSourceProvider())); \`\`\`

\`\`\`cpp // C++ #include <winrt/LottieReactNative.h> #include <winrt/AnimatedVisuals.h>

...

PackageProviders().Append(winrt::LottieReactNative::ReactPackageProvider(winrt::AnimatedVisuals::LottieCodegenSourceProvider())); \`\`\`

Codegen animations are supported by adding LottieAnimation items to your project file. These will be compiled into your application and available at runtime by name. For example:

\`\`\`xml <!-- .vcxproj or .csproj --> <ItemGroup> <LottieAnimation Include="Assets/Animations/MyAnimation.json" Name="MyAnimation" /> </ItemGroup> \`\`\`

\`\`\`js // js <LottieView source={'MyAnimation'} /> \`\`\`

Codegen is available to both C# and C++ applications. Dynamic loading of JSON strings at runtime is currently only supported in C# applications.

</details>

## Usage

Lottie can be used in a declarative way:

\`\`\`jsx import React from 'react'; import LottieView from 'lottie-react-native';

export default function Animation() { return ( <LottieView source={require('../path/to/animation.json')} autoPlay loop /> ); } \`\`\`

Additionally, there is an imperative API which is sometimes simpler.

\`\`\`tsx import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'; import LottieView from 'lottie-react-native';

export default function AnimationWithImperativeApi() { const animationRef = useRef<LottieView>(null);

useEffect(() => { animationRef.current?.play();

// Or set a specific startFrame and endFrame with: animationRef.current?.play(30, 120); }, []);

return ( <LottieView ref={animationRef} source={require('../path/to/animation.json')} /> ); } \`\`\`

Lottie's animation view can be controlled by either React Native Animated or Reanimated API.

\`\`\`tsx import React, { useEffect, useRef, Animated } from 'react'; import { Animated, Easing } from 'react-native'; import LottieView from 'lottie-react-native';

const AnimatedLottieView = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(LottieView);

export default function ControllingAnimationProgress() { const animationProgress = useRef(new Animated.Value(0));

useEffect(() => { Animated.timing(animationProgress.current, { toValue: 1, duration: 5000, easing: Easing.linear, useNativeDriver: false, }).start(); }, []);

return ( <AnimatedLottieView source={require('../path/to/animation.json')} progress={animationProgress.current} /> ); } \`\`\`

Changing color of layers:

NOTE: This feature may not work properly on Android. We will try fix it soon.

\`\`\`jsx import React from 'react'; import LottieView from 'lottie-react-native';

export default function ChangingColorOfLayers() { return ( <LottieView source={require('../path/to/animation.json')} colorFilters={[ { keypath: 'button', color: '#F00000', }, { keypath: 'Sending Loader', color: '#F00000', }, ]} autoPlay loop /> ); } \`\`\`

## If you want to use \`.lottie\` files

You need to modify your \`metro.config.js\` file accordingly by adding \`lottie\` extension to the \`assetExts\` array:

\`\`\`js const { getDefaultConfig, mergeConfig } = require('@react-native/metro-config');

const defaultConfig = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

/** * Metro configuration * https://facebook.github.io/metro/docs/configuration * * @type {import('metro-config').MetroConfig} */ const config = { resolver: { assetExts: [...defaultConfig.resolver.assetExts, 'lottie'], }, };

module.exports = mergeConfig(getDefaultConfig(__dirname), config); \`\`\`

## Setup jest for dotLottie files

Create a file in the following path \`__mocks__/lottieMock.js\` and add the following code:

\`\`\`js module.exports = 'lottie-test-file-stub'; \`\`\`

Then add the following to your \`jest.config.js\` file:

\`\`\`js module.exports = { ... moduleNameMapper: { ..., '\\\\.(lottie)$': '<rootDir>/jest/__mocks__/lottieMock.js', }, ... } \`\`\`

## API

You can find the full list of props and methods available in our [API document](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-react-native/blob/master/docs/api.md). These are the most common ones:

| Prop | Description | Default | | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | **\`source\`** | **Mandatory** - The source of animation. Can be referenced as a local asset by a string, or remotely with an object with a \`uri\` property, or it can be an actual JS object of an animation, obtained (for example) with something like \`require('../path/to/animation.json')\`. | _None_ | | **\`style\`** | Style attributes for the view, as expected in a standard [\`View\`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/layout-props.html). | You need to set it manually. Refer to this [pull request](https://github.com/lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native/pull/992). | | **\`loop\`** | A boolean flag indicating whether or not the animation should loop. | \`true\` | | **\`autoPlay\`** | A boolean flag indicating whether or not the animation should start automatically when mounted. This only affects the imperative API. | \`false\` | | **\`colorFilters\`** | An array of objects denoting layers by KeyPath and a new color filter value (as hex string). | \`[]\` |

## Troubleshooting

Not all After Effects features are supported by Lottie. If you notice there are some layers or animations missing check [this list](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie/blob/master/supported-features.md) to ensure they are supported.

mdn-data@2.0.14
CC0-1.0

CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;

ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;

iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;

vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

# Metro

🚇 The JavaScript bundler for React Native.

- **🚅 Fast**: We aim for sub-second reload cycles, fast startup and quick bundling speeds. - **⚖️ Scalable**: Works with thousands of modules in a single application. - **⚛️ Integrated**: Supports every React Native project out of the box.

This project was previously part of the [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) repository. In this smaller repository it is easier for the team working on Metro to respond to both issues and pull requests. See [react-native#13976](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/13976) for the initial announcement.

(BSD-3-Clause OR GPL-2.0)
https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge
You may use the Forge project under the terms of either the BSD License or the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the Forge project.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under that license.

You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is left intact.

If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative commercial entities for our efforts.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.

(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

react-devtools-core@6.1.5
MIT
https://github.com/facebook/react
# \`react-devtools-core\`

This package provides low-level APIs to support renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native). If you're looking for the standalone React DevTools UI, **we suggest using [\`react-devtools\`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) instead of using this package directly**.

This package provides two entrypoints: labeled "backend" and "standalone" (frontend). Both APIs are described below.

# Backend API

Backend APIs are embedded in _development_ builds of renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) in order to connect to the React DevTools UI.

### Example

If you are building a non-browser-based React renderer, you can use the backend API like so:

\`\`\`js if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') { const { initialize, connectToDevTools } = require("react-devtools-core");

initialize(settings); // Must be called before packages like react or react-native are imported connectToDevTools({...config}); } \`\`\`

> **NOTE** that this API (\`connectToDevTools\`) must be (1) run in the same context as React and (2) must be called before React packages are imported (e.g. \`react\`, \`react-dom\`, \`react-native\`).

### \`initialize\` arguments | Argument | Description | |------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | \`settings\` | Optional. If not specified, or received as null, then default settings are used. Can be plain object or a Promise that resolves with the [plain settings object](#Settings). If Promise rejects, the console will not be patched and some console features from React DevTools will not work. |

#### \`Settings\` | Spec | Default value | |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | <pre>{<br> appendComponentStack: boolean,<br> breakOnConsoleErrors: boolean,<br> showInlineWarningsAndErrors: boolean,<br> hideConsoleLogsInStrictMode: boolean<br>}</pre> | <pre>{<br> appendComponentStack: true,<br> breakOnConsoleErrors: false,<br> showInlineWarningsAndErrors: true,<br> hideConsoleLogsInStrictMode: false<br>}</pre> |

### \`connectToDevTools\` options | Prop | Default | Description | |------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | \`host\` | \`"localhost"\` | Socket connection to frontend should use this host. | | \`isAppActive\` | | (Optional) function that returns true/false, telling DevTools when it's ready to connect to React. | | \`port\` | \`8097\` | Socket connection to frontend should use this port. | | \`resolveRNStyle\` | | (Optional) function that accepts a key (number) and returns a style (object); used by React Native. | | \`retryConnectionDelay\` | \`200\` | Delay (ms) to wait between retrying a failed Websocket connection | | \`useHttps\` | \`false\` | Socket connection to frontend should use secure protocol (wss). | | \`websocket\` | | Custom \`WebSocket\` connection to frontend; overrides \`host\` and \`port\` settings. | | \`onSettingsUpdated\` | | A callback that will be called when the user updates the settings in the UI. You can use it for persisting user settings. | |

### \`connectWithCustomMessagingProtocol\` options | Prop | Description | |---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | \`onSubscribe\` | Function, which receives listener (function, with a single argument) as an argument. Called when backend subscribes to messages from the other end (frontend). | | \`onUnsubscribe\` | Function, which receives listener (function) as an argument. Called when backend unsubscribes to messages from the other end (frontend). | | \`onMessage\` | Function, which receives 2 arguments: event (string) and payload (any). Called when backend emits a message, which should be sent to the frontend. | | \`onSettingsUpdated\` | A callback that will be called when the user updates the settings in the UI. You can use it for persisting user settings. |

Unlike \`connectToDevTools\`, \`connectWithCustomMessagingProtocol\` returns a callback, which can be used for unsubscribing the backend from the global DevTools hook.

# Frontend API

Frontend APIs can be used to render the DevTools UI into a DOM node. One example of this is [\`react-devtools\`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) which wraps DevTools in an Electron app.

### Example \`\`\`js import DevtoolsUI from "react-devtools-core/standalone";

// See the full list of API methods in documentation below. const { setContentDOMNode, startServer } = DevtoolsUI;

// Render DevTools UI into a DOM element. setContentDOMNode(document.getElementById("container"));

// Start socket server used to communicate between backend and frontend. startServer( // Port defaults to 8097 1234,

// Host defaults to "localhost" "example.devserver.com",

// Optional config for secure socket (WSS). { key: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-key.pem'), cert: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-cert.pem') } ); \`\`\`

### Exported methods The \`default\` export is an object defining the methods described below.

These methods support chaining for convenience. For example: \`\`\`js const DevtoolsUI = require("react-devtools-core/standalone"); DevtoolsUI.setContentDOMNode(element).startServer(); \`\`\`

#### \`connectToSocket(socket: WebSocket)\` > This is an advanced config function that is typically not used.

Custom \`WebSocket\` connection to use for communication between DevTools frontend and backend. Calling this method automatically initializes the DevTools UI (similar to calling \`startServer()\`).

#### \`openProfiler()\` Automatically select the "Profiler" tab in the DevTools UI.

#### \`setContentDOMNode(element: HTMLElement)\` Set the DOM element DevTools UI should be rendered into on initialization.

#### \`setDisconnectedCallback(callback: Function)\` _Optional_ callback to be notified when DevTools \`WebSocket\` closes (or errors).

#### \`setProjectRoots(roots: Array<string>)\` _Optional_ set of root directories for source files. These roots can be used to open an inspected component's source code using an IDE.

#### \`setStatusListener(callback: Function)\` _Optional_ callback to be notified of socket server events (e.g. initialized, errored, connected).

This callback receives two parameters: \`\`\`js function onStatus( message: string, status: 'server-connected' | 'devtools-connected' | 'error' ): void { // ... } \`\`\`

#### \`startServer(port?: number, host?: string, httpsOptions?: Object, loggerOptions?: Object)\` Start a socket server (used to communicate between backend and frontend) and renders the DevTools UI.

This method accepts the following parameters: | Name | Default | Description | |---|---|---| | \`port\` | \`8097\` | Socket connection to backend should use this port. | | \`host\` | \`"localhost"\` | Socket connection to backend should use this host. | | \`httpsOptions\` | | _Optional_ object defining \`key\` and \`cert\` strings. | | \`loggerOptions\` | | _Optional_ object defining a \`surface\` string (to be included with DevTools logging events). |

# Development

Watch for changes made to the backend entry point and rebuild: \`\`\`sh yarn start:backend \`\`\`

Watch for changes made to the standalone UI entry point and rebuild: \`\`\`sh yarn start:standalone \`\`\`

Run the standalone UI using \`yarn start\` in the [\`react-devtools\`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools).

# Node Stream Buffers

[![Build Status][badge-travis-img]][badge-travis-url] [![Code Climate][badge-climate-img]][badge-climate-url] [![Code Coverage][badge-coverage-img]][badge-coverage-url]

Simple Readable and Writable Streams that use a [Buffer][node-buffer-docs] to store received data, or for data to send out. Useful for test code, debugging, and a wide range of other utilities.

## Installation

[![NPM][badge-npm-img]][badge-npm-url]

## Usage

To use the stream buffers in your module, simply import it and away you go.

\`\`\`js var streamBuffers = require("stream-buffers"); \`\`\`

### Writable StreamBuffer

Writable Stream Buffers implement the standardized writable stream interface. All write()'s to this object will accumulate in an internal Buffer. If the Buffer overflows it will be resized larger automatically. The initial size of the Buffer and the amount in which it grows can be configured in the constructor.

\`\`\`js var myWritableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.WritableStreamBuffer({ initialSize: (100 * 1024), // start as 100 kilobytes. incrementAmount: (10 * 1024)	// grow by 10 kilobytes each time buffer overflows. }); \`\`\`

The default initial size and increment amount are stored in the following constants:

\`\`\`js streamBuffers.DEFAULT_INITIAL_SIZE // (8 * 1024) streamBuffers.DEFAULT_INCREMENT_AMOUNT	// (8 * 1024) \`\`\`

Writing is standard Stream stuff:

\`\`\`js myWritableStreamBuffer.write(myBuffer); // - or - myWritableStreamBuffer.write("\\u00bd + \\u00bc = \\u00be", "utf8"); \`\`\`

You can query the size of the data being held in the Buffer, and also how big the Buffer's max capacity currently is:

\`\`\`js myWritableStreamBuffer.write("ASDF"); streamBuffers.size(); // 4. streamBuffers.maxSize(); // Whatever was configured as initial size. In our example: (100 * 1024). \`\`\`

Retrieving the contents of the Buffer is simple:

\`\`\`js myWritableStreamBuffer.getContents(); // Gets all held data as a Buffer. myWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString("utf8"); // Gets all held data as a utf8 string. myWritableStreamBuffer.getContents(5); // Gets first 5 bytes as a Buffer. myWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString("utf8", 5);	// Gets first 5 bytes as a utf8 string. \`\`\`

Care should be taken when getting encoded strings from WritableStream, as it doesn't really care about the contents (multi-byte characters will not be respected). Destroying or ending the WritableStream will not delete the contents of Buffer, but will disallow any further writes:

\`\`\`js myWritableStreamBuffer.write("ASDF"); myWritableStreamBuffer.destroy();

myWritableStreamBuffer.getContents(); // Returns ASDF in Buffer. myWritableStreamBuffer.write("Yeah?"); // No effect. \`\`\`

### Readable StreamBuffer

Readable Stream Buffers can have data inserted in them, which will then be pumped out via standard readable stream data events. The data to be sent out is held in a Buffer, which can grow in much the same way as a WritableStream Buffer does, if data is being put in Buffer faster than it's being pumped out.

The frequency in which chunks are pumped out, and the size of the chunks themselves can be configured in the constructor. The initial size and increment amount of internal Buffer can be configured too.

\`\`\`js var myReadableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.ReadableStreamBuffer({ frequency: 10, // in milliseconds. chunkSize: 2048 // in bytes. }); \`\`\`

Default frequency and chunk size:

\`\`\`js streamBuffers.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE // (1024) streamBuffers.DEFAULT_FREQUENCY // (1) \`\`\`

Putting data in Buffer to be pumped out is easy:

\`\`\`js myReadableStreamBuffer.put(aBuffer); myReadableStreamBuffer.put("A String", "utf8"); \`\`\`

Chunks are pumped out via standard readable stream spec:

\`\`\`js myReadableStreamBuffer.on("data", function(data) { // Yup. assert.isTrue(data instanceof Buffer); }); \`\`\`

Chunks are pumped out by the interval that you specified in frequency. Setting the frequency to 0 will immediately stream the data (also in chunks), even if the stream has not been piped to a destination. This is useful for unit testing.

setEncoding() for streams is respected too:

\`\`\`js myReadableStreamBuffer.setEncoding("utf8"); myReadableStreamBuffer.on("data", function(data) { assert.isTrue(data instanceof String); }); \`\`\`

Pause and resume are also implemented. pause()'ing stream will allow buffer to continue accumulating, but will not pump any of that data out until it is resume()'d again.

Destroying the stream will immediately purge the buffer, unless destroySoon() is called, in which case the rest of the buffer will be written out. Either way, any further attempts to put data in the Buffer will be silently ignored.

\`\`\`js myReadableStreamBuffer.destroySoon(); myReadableStreamBuffer.put("A String!"); myReadableStreamBuffer.size(); // will be 0. \`\`\`

## Disclaimer

Not supposed to be a speed demon, it's more for tests/debugging or weird edge cases. It works with an internal buffer that it copies contents to/from/around.

This library is a parser and serializer for the [Structured Headers][1] specification, a.k.a. "Structured Field Values for HTTP" (RFC8941).

This specification defines a standard serialization for complex HTTP header values, including lists (arrays), dictionaries (maps) and also numbers, booleans, and binary data.

The library is written in Typescript, and the examples in this document are too, but plain Javascript is also fully supported.

Compatibility -------------

This package has 2725 unittests, the vast majority are supplied from the official [HTTP WG test suite][2].

However, there are 2 differences in the serializer:

1. Javascript can't differentiate between \`1.0\` and \`1\`. As a result we're skipping the tests that require a serialiation output of \`1.0\`. 2. Javascript rounds slightly different from the spec. The tests suggest that \`0.0025\` should round to the nearest event number (\`0.002\`), but Javascript rounds to \`0.003\`.

No fix is planned for #1, because there's no reasonably way to fix this without wrapping every number in a custom class, and this will negatively impact the developer experience. We do intend to fix #2 in the future with a custom rounding algorithm.

This library emits and expects the _exact_ data structures as they are suggested by the RFC. The result of this is that the returned types can be a bit complex.

In the future we intend to loosen the required types for the serializer, and add new helper functions that give you simpler structures _if_ you don't need certain features for a header (such as \`Parameters\`).

Let us know what you would like to see here!

Installation ------------

Using npm:

\`\`\` npm install structured-headers \`\`\`

API ---

### Parsing an item

The following are examples of \`item\` headers:

Parsed as string

\`\`\` # Parsed as string Header: "foo"

# A simple string, called a 'Token' in the spec Header: foo

# Parsed as number Header: 5 Header: -10 Header: 5.01415

# Parsed into boolean Header: ?1 Header: ?0

# Binaries are base64 encoded Header: :RE0gbWUgZm9yIGEgZnJlZSBjb29raWU=:

# Items can have parameters Header: "Hello world"; a="5" \`\`\`

To parse these header values, use the \`parseItem\`:

\`\`\`typescript import { parseItem } from 'structured-headers';

console.log( parseItem(header) ); \`\`\`

parseItem returns a tuple (array with 2 items), the first item is the value, the second is a \`Map\` object with parameters.

The type is roughly:

\`\`\`typescript

// The raw value type BareItem = number | string | Token | ByteSequence | boolean;

// The return type of parseItem type Item = [ BareItem, Map<string, BareItem> ]; \`\`\`

### Parsing a list

A list is an array of items. Some examples:

\`\`\` # A simple list Header: 5, "foo", bar, ?1

# Each element can have parameters Header: sometoken; param1; param2=hi, 42

# A list can also contain lists itself. These are called 'inner lists' and # use parenthesis Header: sometoken, (innerlistitem1 innerlistitem2), (anotherlist) \`\`\`

To parse these:

\`\`\`typescript import { parseList } from 'structured-headers';

console.log( parseList(header) ); \`\`\`

\`parseList\` returns an array with each member. The return type is:

\`\`\`typescript type InnerList = [Item[], Parameters]; type List = (InnerList|Item)[]; \`\`\`

### Parsing a dictionary

A dictionary is a key->value object. Examples:

\`\`\` # A simple dictionary Header: fn="evert", ln="pot", coffee=?1

# Each item may have parameters too Header: foo=123; q=1, bar=123, q=0.5

# A dictionary value may be an inner list again Header: foo=(1 2 3) \`\`\`

To parse dictionaries:

\`\`\`typescript import { parseDictionary } from 'structured-headers';

console.log( parseDictionary(header) ); \`\`\`

The return type for \`parseDictionary\` is a \`Map\`.

\`\`\`typescript type Dictionary = Map<string, Item|InnerList>; \`\`\`

### Serializing

The serialiser functions work the exact same way, but in opposite direction. They all return strings.

Currently the serializes expect the *exact type* that the parsers return, but the intention is to loosen the types for serialization, so it's a bit more ergnomic to call. Want this? Let me know by opening an issue.

\`\`\`javascript import { serializeDictionary, serializeList, serializeItem } from 'structured-headers';

// Returns "foo", "bar" serializeList([ ['foo', new Map()], ['bar', new Map()], ]);

// Returns a=1, b=?0 sh.serializeDictionary(new Map([ ['a', [1, new Map()]], ['b', [false, new Map()]], ]));

// Returns 42 serializeItem([42, new Map()]);

// Returns 5.5 serializeItem([5.5, new Map()]);

// Returns "hello world" serializeItem(["hello world", new Map()]);

// Returns ?1 serializeItem([true, new Map()]);

// Returns a base-64 representation like: *aGVsbG8=* serializeItem([new ByteSequence('aGVsbG8='), new Map()]); \`\`\`

Browser support ---------------

There is a minified version of this library in the \`browser/\` directory. This minified file will expose a global variable called 'structuredHeader' which contains the rest of the api.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
